## What it Does

Have you ever been running and listening to music, and felt the satisfaction of your footfalls perfectly lining up with the music's beat? Or have you ever made a pump up playlists to help you hit your target pace for an upcoming race? Tempo Trainer seeks to combine these two feelings to make a happier and faster runner, by generating playlists made of *your music* whose tempo match your stride length and help you meet your pace.

## How it Works

Start by inputting your gender and height, this helps us get a rough idea of how long each of your strides is. Once you do that, choose which sources you want to pull from to make your new playlist. The beauty of Tempo Trainer is that it makes playlists of only *your music*, so you like everything you hear. Finally, input the target pace you'd like to hit in minutes per mile. We'll do a calculation based on your stride length and your pace to find the tempo your music should match, and then filter the songs you selected and generate a playlists of only those that will help you meet your pace.
